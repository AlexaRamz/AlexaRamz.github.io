            <i>Wild Lasers</i> is a wild west and sci-fi themed plaformer-shooter game I led and developed as a part of UCI's Video Game Design Club using Unity. The game features a unique mechanic where the player must depend on shooting a gun for both movement and combat.

          <h2>Background</h2>
          This game was the first project I led as part of UCI's Video Game Design Club. Looking to create a game with an intriguing and original game mechanic, the idea I proposed to my team was a unique take on a platformer where instead of running and jumping, the player would depend solely on shooting for movement as well as for combat. Furthermore, as a dabbler in character design, I thought about creating a cast of space hero characters, an alien species from each planet in the solar system with unique designs and colors corresponding to their place of origin. Working as artist and programmer for art and visual effects, this project was a chance to channel some of these ideas into the game's visuals, feel, and environment.

          <h2>Leading a Team</h2>
          Feeling confident in my abilities as a game developer, I decided to try leading a beginner-friendly game project. My team and I started by brainstorming additional gameplay and story ideas. We had a lot of fun playing around with ideas, with one of my favorites being that the player would have three guns with distinct personalities that talk to you. However, a third into the project, we feared that we had spent too much time coming up with ideas and wouldn't be able to implement all of them. In time I understood that we needed to reduce the scope of our project. I also realized my mistake of expecting all brainstorming to be done during meetings rather than leveraging the independent work of my team's game designers and writers to reduce planning time. I immediately had programmers commence their work on the game's core mechanics. I discussed with game designers to shrink our plan to something more feasible, and I left the final details and level designs up to them. We were only able to complete one level, and weren't able to include all of our story ideas, but we were still pretty proud of how much we did complete.
