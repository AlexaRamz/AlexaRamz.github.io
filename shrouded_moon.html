          <h5>Enemies</h5>
          The game has two enemies inspired by Yokai, supernatural entities in Japanese folklore. As programmer, I was responsible for setting up most features for the two enemies, including their movement AI, animation, collision, and health.

          <h5>Movement States</h5>
          One of my goals was to create a simple system to manage all the different movement types an enemy could have and allow them to switch between different movement states with ease. An enemy can be a ground or flying type and be in any of three states: wander, patrol, or chase.

          <h5>Edge and Wall Detection</h5>
          To make enemy behavior more realistic, I attempted to make enemies be able to avoid running off edges or smashing into walls. Ground enemies in the wandering state will reverse their direction right before reaching an edge or wall.

          <h2>Enemy Health</h2>
          Finally, I created a health system for enemies that allows them to take a variable amount of damage from the player, and get destroyed when all health has run out. To make hitting an enemy more responsive and satisfying, I had the enemy flicker red when damaged, and I had the amount of damage inflicted be displayed as a particle dropping from the enemy.
