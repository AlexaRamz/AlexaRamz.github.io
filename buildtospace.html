          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            &emsp;<i>Build to Space</i> began as a personal exploration of the building genre. Inspired to combine the building mechanics of Kerbal Space Program, Bad Piggies, and Roblox's Build a Boat For Treasure, I envisioned a game where players could construct and customize everything from spaceships to defensive structures, vehicles, and factories. 
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;Taking the lead within UCI's Video Game Development Club for two quarters, I transformed my initial prototype into a collaborative project. We worked together to develop the core building and piloting systems, allowing players to unleash their creativity as they conquer the challenges of reaching space.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;As the project remains ongoing, I will continue to work on the game individually. My focus will be on expanding building features and refining existing gameplay to ensure an engaging and immersive experience.
