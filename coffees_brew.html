          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            &emsp;My love for creating characters began in my teenage years. I would draw adorable animal characters with outfits and personalities based on unique themes like desserts, beverages, and the seasons. When I stumbled upon the enchanting world of farming RPG <i>Stardew Valley</i>, I was inspired to create my own game where my characters and their stories could come to life. 
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;I envisioned a cozy autumn village in a vibrant pixel art style. Here, the player takes on the role of Coffee, an adventurous cat and secret witch who inherits her parents' cafe. Similar to Stardew Valley, I hope to create gameplay that is both relaxing and challenging so as to appeal to many types of players. You'll engage in the comforting routine of farming ingredients and baking treats, while also embarking on thrilling adventures to hunt down rare potion ingredients and battle monsters â€” all while keeping your magical identity under wraps from the townsfolk.
